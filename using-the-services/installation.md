# Installation

If you just want to use the core CFConfig services outside of the CLI, you can install them like so:

```bash
install cfconfig-services
```

The code in this library has only been tested on Lucee and likely doesn't work on Adobe ColdFusion. If anyone wants to make it compatible, feel free to try but beware of tons of use of the Elvis operator, reliance on sorted JSON structs, and some specific WDDX behavior.
